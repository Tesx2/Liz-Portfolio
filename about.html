          <p class="bio highlight">
            From a young age, I was fascinated by the way colors, shapes, and images could convey powerful messages and evoke emotions.
            Growing up, I was captivated by animated films and graphic novels â€” the ability of artists to create entire worlds and
            characters from their imagination inspired me to pursue a career where I could bring my own ideas to life.
            Graphic design and animation provide a unique platform for personal expression, and I love the challenge of translating
            abstract ideas into visual forms that resonate with people.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            During my studies, I developed strong skills in both graphic design and animation, as well as proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite,
            Blender, and After Effects. I have a passion for creating visually appealing and engaging designs, and I love exploring different
            styles and techniques to communicate ideas. Iâ€™m eager to bring my fresh knowledge and creativity into the industry and am
            particularly interested in working on projects that combine animation and design to tell compelling stories.
